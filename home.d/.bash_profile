# ~/.bash_profile: executed by bash(1) when "login shell" starts.

# This file is sourced only for login shells. It
# should contain commands that should be executed only
# in login shells. It should be used to set the terminal
# type and run a series of external commands (fortune,
# msgs, from, etc.)
#
# If Bash is spawned by login in a TTY, by an SSH daemon,
# or similar means, it is considered a "login shell".
#
# Per-user, after /etc/profile. If this file does not exist,
# ~/.bash_login and ~/.profile are checked in that order.
# The skeleton file /etc/skel/.bash_profile also sources ~/.bashrc
